## Change Log
Sunday, April 19, 2020:
we created the repo and everyone started on thier own pages after a task was assigned to each member,
by the end of the day the search page was almost finished while the other pages were done functionality wise. 

Monday , April 20 , 2020:

 Major shift in the CSS side started to happen as we worked on making the page look consistant and working properly , no connetions between the pages was fully made yet  until the whole functionality is done.
 
 everyday from 9 to 12 PM was assigned to push / merge / pull and reslove conflicts so everyones local repo stays up to date 

 Tuseday , April 21 , 2020 : 
 Search page , home page , movie page , and about us page functionality are 100% done and the styling of the website is almost complete just few finishing touches here and there still remains to happen 

 Wensday , April 22 , 2020:
